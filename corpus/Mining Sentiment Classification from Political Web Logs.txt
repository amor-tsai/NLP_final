Over the last few years the number of web logs and amount of
opinionated data on the World Wide Web has grown
dramatically. Web logs allow people to share their opinions on a
wide range of “hot” topics with virtual communities. As readers
start turning to web logs as a source of information, automatic
techniques that identify the sentiment of web log posts will help
bloggers categorize and filter this exploding information source.
However, on the surface, sentiment classification of web log
posts, in particular political web log posts, appears to be a more
difficult problem than classification of traditional text because of
the interplay among the images, hyperlinks, the style of writing
and language used within web logs. In this paper we investigate
existing technology and their utility for sentiment classification
on web log posts. We show that a Naïve Bayes classifier can on
average correctly predict a posting’s political category 78.06% of
the time with a standard deviation of 2.39. It significantly
outperforms Support Vector Machines at the 99.9% confidence
level with a confidence interval of [1.425, 3.488]. On average,
SVMs correctly predicted the category of web log posts 75.47%
of the time with a standard deviation of 2.64. Previous research
was able to achieve an 81.0% accuracy using Naïve Bayes and
82.9% using SVMs using our chosen feature set representation on
a nonspecific topic corpus. Using our dataset of political
web logs over a two-year period, we also show that it is important
to maintain a uniform distribution in such datasets to avoid biases
in classification.
